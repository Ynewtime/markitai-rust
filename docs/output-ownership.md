# Output ownership and recovery

The Unix CLI coordinates Markdown writers through filesystem member locks. Native
batch recovery additionally records evidence of the exact file object and bytes
published by an item. A saved output path, the six-character state hash, matching
frontmatter, or a content digest alone cannot authorize implicit replacement.

This document describes the implementation contract. Test, process-crash and
release validation results are recorded separately; this document supplies no
claim that those gates have passed.

## Where the protocol applies

On Unix, single-file and single-URL CLI conversions acquire output member locks but do not
create a recovery checkpoint or publication receipt. Directory and URL-list runs
also maintain native checkpoints and receipts. Disabling reports does not disable
batch recovery storage. Stdout-only conversions and dry runs do not acquire
output claims; empty discovery without a stored run creates no persistence shell.

The existing core conversion functions and Node.js, Python and Go bindings do not
join this CLI protocol or create its metadata. The CLI passes an explicit native
publication callback into core; rendered Markdown, asset rewriting and result
paths still come from core. This includes a base document written before an LLM
failure is returned. There is no process-global callback or new binding JSON field.

Native claims currently require Unix file identities and locking. Other platforms
retain ordinary single/batch conversion without claims or recovery storage;
`--resume` fails before provider work. Windows recovery is not implemented, and
the portable fallback has host-side tests rather than Windows release validation.
Host conversion APIs retain their existing publication path.

## Locks follow actual filesystem names

For each actual output parent, stable lock files live at:

```text
<parent>/.markitai/ownership/members/<document member filename>
```

A family normally reserves `name.md` and `name.llm.md`, even when a conversion
ultimately writes only one of them. Thus `name` and `name.llm` overlap at
`name.llm.md`. The claim validates the exact members core may publish. Explicit
filenames and `llm.keep_base` still determine which member receives enhanced text.

The original parent spelling is checked against `output.allow_symlinks` before
physical resolution. Locks use the member filename itself. When case or Unicode
spellings refer to the same lock file on the actual filesystem, its device/inode
identity also gives the same in-process reservation key. Lowercasing strings is
not used as a substitute for filesystem identity. Permitted parent aliases reach
the same physical metadata directory.

Each active item holds nonblocking OS locks for its family. Unrelated families
can proceed concurrently; there is no long-lived lock for the whole output
directory. Lock files remain after release and are never unlinked as a cleanup
step. Their presence alone does not indicate an active process. Publication
rechecks the held lock paths, directory identities and requested member.

Ordinary rename policy can try another version when a candidate is occupied or
busy. An owned retry must use its verified family. A skipped existing output does
not become owned by the skipped item and does not create a receipt. Completed
entries retain name reservations even when their output files have disappeared.
Those planning reservations do not themselves grant write authority.

## Durable prepared receipts

Native receipts are stored separately from locks:

```text
<parent>/.markitai/ownership/records/<full-sha256>.json
```

The locator hashes the full owner and exact family. The bounded receipt body is
also validated against them. The owner includes checkpoint generation, mode,
resolved input/output scope, typed file-or-URL identity and the raw item key. A
named URL retains its raw name in this key; it is not reconstructed from a
sanitized output filename.

Each member records its exact target and, when a write is prepared:

- The private temporary basename and staged regular-file proof: device, inode,
  byte length and SHA-256 of the actual bytes.
- The expected prior object, if any, with the same proof and an explicit
  `explicit_overwrite` or `native_owned` authority.

An explicitly permitted symlink replacement records the symlink object's identity
and link-text bytes. It never follows the link merely to authorize publication.
An implicit retry cannot replace an unrelated symlink.

Publication performs these steps while the item holds its member locks:

1. Validate the owner, receipt and current family, then capture the expected
   destination. An ordinary new write requires absence; a native retry requires
   matching evidence; explicit overwrite supplies separate authority.
2. Write the rendered document to a temporary file in the output parent and sync
   it. Persist the prepared receipt by atomic replacement, syncing both receipt
   file and receipt directory before touching the output target.
3. Recheck the staged object and expected destination. Publish with atomic
   no-clobber semantics for an absent destination, or replacement for the exact
   authorized prior object. Sync the output directory before acknowledging success.

There is no required second receipt commit after document publication. Renaming
the staged file preserves its file identity, so the durable prepared record can
prove that publication happened even if the process stops before returning or
recording task completion. Preparing a later attempt replaces this evidence only
after retaining the currently authorized prior proof.

For fresh explicit overwrite, the change-detection window starts when publication
preparation captures the destination, after conversion. Native retries are also
verified before expensive work and again at publication. Neither check provides
an atomic compare-and-replace against an uncooperative writer.

## Recovery decisions

| Observed member | Recovery behavior |
|---|---|
| Matches the prepared identity, length and digest | Recognize the native publication and allow an owned retry. |
| Matches the recorded authorized prior object | Retain the original authorization after a pre-rename interruption. |
| Absent | Recreate using no-clobber publication, subject to owner/receipt validation. |
| Same bytes but another inode, or changed bytes on the same inode | Preserve the object and fail the implicit retry. |
| Existing object without matching evidence | Do not infer ownership from the path or content. |
| Malformed, foreign or conflicting native receipt | Fail without replacing the output or silently discarding evidence. |

Only failed entries, including interrupted entries normalized to failed after
journal replay, receive native target-reuse treatment. Pending entries use normal
conflict policy. Legacy checkpoints have no native receipt authority; their
unfinished items use configured rename, skip or explicit overwrite rather than
silently overwriting a saved target. A fresh generation cannot inherit an older
generation's implicit authority.

Legacy unfinished targets are cleared before a fresh native checkpoint is saved.
This prevents an interruption during that upgrade from promoting an unproved
legacy path into a native retry target on the next run.

One interruption window deliberately fails safely: a fresh explicit-overwrite
run can record its target and begin conversion before any publication receipt
exists. If it is killed there, an existing target has no native evidence and
resume rejects implicit replacement. The user can start a fresh run with explicit
overwrite. An admission-time durable authorization record for this window is not
implemented; recovery is not seamless at every possible kill point.

Completed entries retain their completed state without rereading or regenerating
their outputs. Receipt shape can disambiguate a result such as `x.llm.md`: it may
be the enhanced member of `x` or the base member of literal stem `x.llm`. This
lookup checks at most two candidate receipts and grants no publication authority.
Without unambiguous evidence, planning conservatively reserves both families.

When a native failed bare URL is adopted into its first discovered named key,
the CLI verifies the old family and durably copies its receipt under the new full
owner before saving the merged checkpoint. The old receipt remains, so a crash
before checkpoint replacement still permits recovery with the old key. An
existing destination receipt must contain identical member evidence. The copy
does not transfer authority across a generation, scope or underlying URL.
Completed-key adoption does not migrate overwrite authority or revalidate edited
completed documents. Retained URL entries keep their original source-list
provenance and mirrored output parent.

## State, interruptions and limits

The coordinator saves merged keys before dispatch. It obtains a claim and flushes
`in_progress` with its selected base target before releasing work to a converter.
Receipt persistence occurs at actual document publication. Buffered terminal
states use the configured flush interval; final compaction records known results.
A storage failure stops new work and is reported separately from conversion
failures. It does not turn a partial invocation into a normal finished report.

The first SIGINT or SIGTERM stops new dispatch, flushes known state and drains
active synchronous conversions. Shutdown time depends on their configured
timeouts and retries; this does not forcibly cancel an in-flight request. A second
signal exits immediately without promising another flush. Receipts preserve
publication evidence independently of terminal state acknowledgement.

This is not an exactly-once conversion or billing protocol. A crash can require
another provider call. Base and enhanced members are published separately, so a
failed operation can leave a valid partial family. Asset files use the separate
content-addressed writer and are not covered by document receipts.

Receipts are limited to 64 KiB and read with a bounded buffer. File proofs are
computed with bounded streaming reads. Ownership directories and receipt files
must be private, ordinary filesystem objects on the output filesystem; metadata
symlinks are rejected. Normal failures remove only the staged object still
matching the recorded proof. Crash-orphan staging and receipt garbage collection
are not automatic.

Receipt contents include plaintext paths and raw URL keys, which can contain
query credentials. Private permissions are not encryption. Diagnostics do not
echo receipt bodies or owner keys. Development and tests must use isolated output
directories and `MARKITAI_HOME`; ownership metadata never requires reading the
user's real configuration home.

The guarantee covers cooperating CLI writers and detected external edits or
replacements. Bindings and other programs are external writers. A hostile writer
racing verification and rename, hostile parent replacement, or a coherently forged
checkpoint plus receipt is outside this guarantee. Filesystem locking and sync
behavior must also be supported by the underlying filesystem. The protocol is
not a security sandbox or a claim that pathname validation authenticates files.
