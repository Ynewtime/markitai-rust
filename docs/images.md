# Images and shared assets

Raster preparation lives in the Rust core, so CLI and language adapters use the
same decoding, resize and asset rules. Native decoding uses no Python process or
external image editor. Optional [image enrichment](image-enrichment.md) can fetch
actual remote image references before passing their bytes to these decoders. The enabled codecs are JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF and
WebP. Static SVG inputs are rendered natively with resvg. HEIF/AVIF decoding
remains unfinished.

## Standalone inputs

A standalone raster file with LLM enabled is decoded within resource limits and
sent as actual image content to the configured vision-capable model pool.
Orientation is applied when encoding a new payload. The
base document retains a local image reference, while the enhanced document is
the model's Markdown. Standalone inputs bypass embedded-image size filtering.
When re-encoding GIF or animated WebP, the first image supplies the pixels.
With compression disabled their original streams are retained; provider-specific
animation handling has not been validated. Multi-page TIFF follows the document
page workflow below; animated GIF/WebP frames are not treated as document pages.

With both LLM and OCR disabled, CLI image items are skipped with
`skip_reason="image_only"`; no Markdown file is written. The shared library API
returns a conversion error explaining `llm=True` and `ocr=True`, matching the
reference Python API. Missing files still report a missing-file error.

`ocr=True` without LLM selects [local image OCR](ocr.md) on macOS. With LLM
enabled, it selects image vision unless `MARKITAI_NO_VLM_OCR` disables that
upload; then local OCR supplies text for enhancement without image blocks.
[PDF page OCR and screenshots](pdf-rendering.md) use the native macOS renderer.
HEIF/AVIF conversion remains unfinished. [Browser screenshots](browser.md)
are available with an installed Chromium executable.

## Multi-page TIFF

TIFF and BigTIFF content is detected from bytes, including under a misleading
supported image suffix. All linked page directories are inspected before OCR,
preview encoding or a model request. Pages retain their file order and each
page's EXIF orientation. Grayscale, RGB, RGBA and CMYK use the existing native
TIFF/image codecs; unsupported sample layouts or compression methods fail
explicitly. Additional TIFF SubIFD thumbnails are not extra document pages.

A multi-page document contains an original TIFF download link, then a page marker
and preview for every page. The original bytes are retained even when compression
is enabled. Page previews use the configured encoder, or lossless PNG at original
upright dimensions when compression is disabled. MIME types describe the encoded
bytes. Single-page TIFF retains its existing one-preview output.

Local OCR recognizes each upright page before advancing to the next page. It
receives original-resolution RGB pixels composited over white, independently of
preview resizing. Blank pages retain their marker and preview with a page-specific
warning. With vision enabled, all page previews are sent in order in one request;
`MARKITAI_NO_VLM_OCR` selects local OCR and sends only recognized text for LLM
enhancement. This extends the reference vision route, which previously prepared
only one TIFF preview. The reference local OCR route already reads all TIFF pages.

Limits are 1,000 pages, 32 million pixels per page, 2 billion cumulative pixels,
100 MiB of multi-page input, and 256 MiB of retained original/encoded asset and
vision bytes combined. Decoding retains one page's pixels at a time, with the
existing 256 MiB decoder allocation ceiling. Encoders fail at their remaining
byte budget rather than returning a truncated image. OCR Markdown is bounded to
64 MiB. These are resource budgets, not a measured peak-RSS guarantee: codec
workspaces, orientation/white-background buffers and request serialization need
additional memory. A positive `llm.max_vision_pages_per_document` is checked before
any page pixels are decoded for vision; it does not restrict local OCR. Malformed
later pages or exhausted limits fail the whole operation, rather than reporting
earlier pages as a complete document.

Embedded multi-page TIFF assets are preserved unchanged during ordinary asset
compression, so that pass cannot flatten them to the first frame. Image analysis
uses the same all-page vision preparation. No external decoder or Python runtime
is used. HEIF/AVIF support and cross-platform local OCR remain separate work.

## SVG inputs

A standalone SVG retains its original bytes as the document's SVG asset. The
vision request receives a separate PNG rendered in process; no Python, browser,
external executable or network fetch is involved. Actual raster magic takes
precedence over an incorrect `.svg` suffix, and SVG XML under a supported image
suffix is recognized as SVG. UTF-8 XML, viewBox sizing, static shapes, gradients,
clipping, masks, text and embedded base64 PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP images use resvg's
static renderer. The PNG preserves transparency and renders at 2048 pixels wide with proportional
height, matching the reference's default vision width even for small vector
viewBoxes. Raster compression and maximum-width settings do not lower this
vector preview resolution. An output exceeding 32 million pixels is rejected
before allocating the canvas. Renderer and font differences remain possible.

System fonts are loaded lazily once when text is present. Their files are the
only ambient rendering resources read. SVG-specified file paths and network
resources are never loaded. Font selection therefore depends on installed fonts;
missing required fonts or glyphs are explicit errors. Empty or fully transparent
renderings fail instead of uploading a blank image. Script/event handlers,
animation, foreignObject, XML processing instructions/DTDs, external image/use
references and nested SVG data images are rejected. Hyperlinks are preserved
but never followed. Unsupported SVG features outside resvg's static support are
not claimed to have browser fidelity. Embedded SVG assets inside other document
formats retain the existing original-byte/warning path. Standalone SVG vision, local OCR and [image enrichment](image-enrichment.md)
use the separate bounded PNG.

## Descriptions in history archives

[Image enrichment](image-enrichment.md) can publish an `images.json` index beside
the output assets. CLI history merges indexes from all copied source roots. It
keeps the first index's header and all matching source records, including distinct
descriptions of an asset whose identical bytes share one archived file. Each
record's `path` is rewritten using the actual collision-renaming map to the final
history directory; the remaining record fields are preserved. Indexes no longer
point back to the original output directories after those directories are removed.

Shared indexes may describe assets outside the current archive. Rows without an
asset in the copied set, missing/invalid file paths, and URI paths are omitted;
stderr reports the number omitted. Invalid JSON or a non-array `images` field
fails the optional archive, preserving the source and converted outputs. Reading
all source indexes has a combined 16 MiB limit, each merged index has a 16 MiB
serialization limit, and index bytes also count toward the archive budget.
Internal `.images.lock` files are validated as regular files and excluded from
the archive. Symlinked index/lock leaves are rejected.

## Embedded assets

After document extraction and before output profiles, the core processes raster
assets already held in memory. It applies EXIF orientation, configured minimum
width/height/area filters and raw-byte deduplication. All references to a duplicate
are rewritten to the retained asset. Filtering removes rendered references;
examples inside code spans and fenced blocks remain literal.

Each preparation stage collects original paths and applies one mapping to the
document. File publication does the same for content-addressed destinations in
both base and enhanced Markdown. A generated filename matching another original
asset name therefore cannot redirect or remove an already relocated reference.
When input assets use the same source path more than once, the first entry
determines that path's reference mapping, including retained or filtered assets.
The original asset order is preserved.

Rewriting handles Markdown links, reference definitions, wikilinks and exact
frontmatter path scalars, plus HTML `a[href]`, `img[src/srcset]`,
`source[src/srcset]`, `video[src/poster]`, `audio[src]` and `track[src]`.
All relevant attributes are visited once; the first duplicate attribute wins.
Candidate lists preserve surviving descriptors and URI suffixes. Filtering a
candidate retains alternatives; filtering media destinations removes the affected
attribute rather than its container. Audio/video sources alone do not count as
image references; image candidate lists and video posters do. Static CSS resource
positions in actual style attributes/blocks are also relocated, as specified in
[CSS resources](css-resources.md). Ordinary CSS strings, custom lazy-load
attributes, code and comments remain literal.

With compression enabled, maximum width/height use proportional Lanczos resize.
JPEG uses the configured quality and composites alpha onto white. PNG keeps
transparency. WebP currently uses a lossless native encoder, with a warning that
`image.quality` has no effect for WebP. Native encoded bytes are not claimed to
match Pillow's encoders; image-output parity needs pixel/quality measurements in
addition to the existing strict asset-hash audit.

With compression disabled, supported embedded image bytes remain unchanged.
The actual decoded format determines the output suffix. Standalone JPEG/PNG/
WebP/GIF assets and vision payloads also preserve original bytes in this mode;
BMP/TIFF previews become PNG without resizing. Metadata such as EXIF orientation
is retained in the unchanged payload; orientation is baked in only when encoding
new pixels. Provider size limits are not yet reproduced for every service.

Unsupported or malformed embedded images retain their original bytes with a
warning. This is an explicit fidelity choice: conversion does not quietly erase
an asset simply because its codec is unavailable. Non-image attachments bypass
raster processing entirely. Input files are never modified.

## Resource boundaries

Each raster decode allows at most 32 million pixels and a 256 MiB decoder
allocation budget. Dimensions are checked before decoded pixel allocation;
codec limits can reject earlier. The total temporary working set may be larger
while resizing, compositing or encoding because those buffers coexist. This is
not a peak-RSS guarantee. General local inputs have the reference's 500 MiB
preflight limit; individual parsers retain their tighter format-specific limits.

SVG XML is limited to 8 MiB, 50,000 nodes and 64 nesting levels before the recursive XML parser or renderer runs.
The natural SVG canvas and the total decoded embedded raster pixels each have
a 32-million-pixel limit. SVG render surfaces, font data, geometry, filter
temporaries and encoding buffers can coexist; these bounds are not a total
process-memory or execution-time guarantee. PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP embedded payloads
also pass the existing raster decoder limits. No SVGZ decompressor is enabled.

The implementation uses the bounded decoder interfaces in
[image](https://docs.rs/image/0.25.10/image/struct.ImageReader.html) and its
[resource limits](https://docs.rs/image/0.25.10/image/struct.Limits.html).
No codec downloads or external executable installation occur during conversion.
SVG uses [resvg 0.48.1](https://docs.rs/resvg/0.48.1/resvg/) with explicit text,
system-font and raster-image features. Its binary size contribution has not yet
been measured in this implementation round.
