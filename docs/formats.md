# Document formats and conversion contracts

The Rust engine parses documents locally and returns a `Document`: Markdown,
metadata, embedded asset bytes and explicit warnings. It never writes assets or
fetches external content inside a format adapter. Output naming, profiles,
network policy and optional model enhancement belong to the orchestration layer.

## Implemented readers

| Inputs | Reader | Current behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TXT, MD, MARKDOWN | Rust text decoder | Preserves text and existing frontmatter; accepts UTF-8, BOM-marked UTF-16 and Windows-1252 |
| HTML, HTM, XHTML | scraper + htmd | Selects an article/main candidate, extracts metadata, removes navigation/scripts/hidden content, resolves relative HTTP links and images |
| CSV, TSV | csv | CSV preserves the reference's header width and raw cells; TSV retains the widest row and escapes table delimiters |
| IPYNB | serde_json | Markdown cells, fenced code and raw cells; metadata title and code language; code fences sized to protect embedded backticks |
| JSON | serde_json | Validated, pretty-printed fenced JSON; an additive Rust format |
| XML | quick-xml | Structured headings, attributes and mixed text, plus a source fence for small inputs; document types are rejected |
| EML | mail-parser | Decoded subject, body and MIME attachments; attachment bytes returned separately |
| MSG | cfb + native properties | Outlook headers, Unicode/ANSI body, HTML fallback and bounded by-value attachments |
| RST, Org, TeX | native markup readers | Structured sections, lists, code, math, links and tables; unsupported constructs retained with warnings |
| JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP | image + native LLM transport + macOS Vision | Standalone vision inputs, shared raster assets and complete TIFF page OCR/vision with bounded decoding |
| DOC, DOCX, DOCM | anydoc document model | Headings, styled text, lists, tables, links, formulas, notes and embedded assets |
| PPT, PPS, POT | anydoc document model | Legacy presentation content through the shared Markdown renderer |
| PPTX, PPTM, PPSX, PPSM | bounded ZIP + PresentationML reader | Ordered slide markers, title placeholders, plain text frames, grouped shapes, tables, referenced images, cached chart data and speaker notes |
| XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLSB | anydoc document model | Native sheet content; XLS/XLSX/XLSM single-sheet names are recovered from package metadata; exact cell-format compatibility has not been established |
| ODT, ODS, ODP, RTF | anydoc document model | Native structured documents through the same Markdown renderer |
| EPUB | anydoc + OPF metadata | Spine content and the original title/authors/language/publisher/date/description/identifier preamble |
| PDF | pdf-inspector + lopdf; optional macOS CoreGraphics/Vision | Per-page text/layout, partial recovery and embedded images; explicit local-file page OCR and screenshots through the shared media pipeline |

The native Office renderer reads the document once and preserves referenced
embedded bytes. Shared image preparation then applies configured filtering and
compression. Unreferenced archive images are omitted. References use `.markitai/assets/{name}` until the output layer assigns
final paths. A merged table's origin contains its content; covered cells are
empty, and a warning records this Markdown representation.

OOXML presentations have a separate reader because the generic document model
flattens slide boundaries. The package's presentation relationships and
`sldIdLst` determine slide order, including empty slides; filename sorting and
heading counts do not determine boundaries. Every slide receives
`<!-- Slide number: N -->`. Shapes are stably ordered by their effective top/left
coordinates, with layout/master placeholder coordinates used when missing.
Group children are ordered within their group. As in the reference reader, the
first top-level placeholder with index zero supplies the first-level title;
its type need not literally be `title`. Grouped or later placeholders do not
turn the remainder of the slide into headings. Body text retains paragraph boundaries and does not
acquire extra list markers from master styles, matching the reference's plain
text-frame contract. Shared normal-mode cleanup remains responsible for repeated
footers; pure output keeps the extracted text.

Presentation tables use their first row as the Markdown header. Images remain
at their shape position, keep normalized description text, and return their
original embedded bytes; shared image processing owns encoding. Repeated
references to the same package image share one asset. Cached chart category and
series values become a table; linked workbooks are never opened or recalculated.
Speaker notes follow their slide under `### Notes:`. Missing or malformed slides
retain their numbered marker with a warning, while readable slides survive; a
package with no readable slide fails. Unknown shapes retain available DrawingML
text with a warning, and unsupported charts are explicitly identified. These
fallbacks do not imply complete drawing, chart-type or SmartArt support.

The presentation reader limits packages to 16,384 entries and 10,000 slides,
each XML part to 16 MiB, each asset to 64 MiB and total decompressed parts to
256 MiB. XML has per-part limits of 200,000 nodes and 127 nested elements.
The layout/master cache retains at most 8 MiB of source XML and 50,000 parsed
nodes; larger individual parts can be read within the part limits without being
cached. This avoids accumulating expanded layout trees across large decks.
Document types, escaping package paths, duplicate relationship IDs and malformed
XML are rejected. Internal targets are resolved inside the archive; external
image HTTP(S) URLs may remain references but are not fetched. Failed optional
notes, layouts, charts or images are named in warnings without discarding the
remaining slide content. These limits cover this reader's explicit passes, not
every allocation inside ZIP/XML libraries.

PDF pages with unreliable or missing native text retain their numbered marker
and emit a warning naming the page and the parser's OCR reason. Other pages are
retained. A document with neither readable text nor recoverable images fails
explicitly. An unnamed layout/GID rejection, or a scan classification caused by
declared but unused image resources, can fall back to bounded font-decoded plain
text only when execution inspection finds no used image, inline/pattern-image
warning, visibility signal or stream error, no Type3 font is present, and decoded
text passes conservative Unicode/content checks. Such
pages explicitly warn that reading order, paragraph boundaries and styling may
differ. A scan with executed raster content, garbled text, vector-text and
invisible-text reasons are never overridden by this fallback. Used image XObjects, including those inside nested Form XObjects,
are collected in page order and deduplicated by PDF object identity. Original
JPEG streams are preserved; supported 8-bit DeviceRGB/DeviceGray samples become
PNG. Images are appended to their page rather than positioned within its text.
Unsupported filters, color spaces, remapping, transparency masks and inline
images produce explicit warnings. Metadata/stream/image/asset limits bound the
additional package and image passes; they are not a claim that every upstream
parser allocation is bounded.

Eligible upright text pages also have a conservative positioned-text refinement
for document-wide heading levels, paragraph gaps, continuous styling and complete
ruled tables. Empty cells/columns are preserved; ambiguous geometry retains the
existing page reader. See [PDF layout](pdf.md) for acceptance checks, resource
limits and the cost of the additional parsing pass.

PDF inspection reports invisible rendering modes, transparent text, white text
and very small text when they accompany text operators, including inside forms.
This is a diagnostic contract: complete hidden-text removal and
image-region text grouping remain
unimplemented. The pinned reader patch suppresses nonpainting Tr3/Tr7 text while
preserving graphics state and cursor movement; other visibility and layout
heuristics retain their documented limits in [PDF layout](pdf.md).
The browser runtime is outside this module. No Python interpreter,
Node runtime, Office installation, LibreOffice or hosted extraction service is
used by the readers above.

## Explicit remaining compatibility work

Numbers and HEIF/AVIF decoding remain unfinished. Local and static/automatic URL PDFs support explicit
page rendering, screenshots and OCR through the [PDF media pipeline](pdf-ocr.md),
including its documented accuracy gap. URL media preserves original request
identity while processing downloaded bytes without a second download.
Local image OCR is
available on macOS through [Vision](ocr.md). Standalone SVG
rasterization is implemented with bounded native rendering; referenced embedded
images can use [caption/description analysis](image-enrichment.md).
Multi-page TIFF preserves its original download and every page preview, applying
orientation before local OCR or complete-page model requests. Pixel, page and
encoded-byte budgets reject oversized documents without silently omitting pages. `supports_extension` reports local text readers; standalone image
classification and vision extraction are separate orchestration paths. See
[images](images.md), [MSG](msg.md), [markup](markup.md) and [HTML](html.md) for
their scoped contracts and limits.

The HTML reader implements article selection, structural chrome removal,
technical code blocks, scoped footnote/math recovery and structured announcement
content. It does not reproduce the original engine's complete set of site
resolvers, conversation-thread models, adaptive recovery, schema.org body
fallback or browser CSS visibility. The precise implemented boundaries are in
[HTML](html.md), [code blocks](html-code.md) and
[article selection](html-article.md). Basic success on an HTML fixture is not
evidence that its full extraction contract matches.

The email readers preserve body and attachments, but complete header, attachment
and layout parity is pending. XML now has structured prose and the sample fixture
is exact; arbitrary dialect parity remains open.
Office conversion can differ in whitespace, table header selection, numbering,
anchors, font-driven headings and metadata. Such differences must remain visible
in differential reports rather than being normalized away.

The renderer retains referenced anchors and omits unused ones. EPUB links within
the assembled book keep working through these anchors; they intentionally differ
from the reference's links to source XHTML files that are not exported. DOCX
tables keep their first row as data with a blank Markdown header. ODS uses its
first row as the header and removes wholly empty trailing columns beyond both
content and merged spans. A five-column merged title remains five columns even
when its body data occupies only three; this differs from the reference's
three-column rendering of the ODS fixture. RTF heading bold markers are omitted while other emphasis is
retained. Hidden XLS/XLSX worksheets are currently omitted by the upstream parser
and reported explicitly. XLSB sheet metadata, older XLS code pages other than
Windows-1252, legacy/ODP slide-boundary markers, exact presentation image encoding, PDF table
layout and PDF image placement require further compatibility work.

## Error and output principles

- A malformed or unsupported input returns an error. An error description is
  never persisted as a successful Markdown document.
- Native document parsers do not call remote OCR automatically.
- HTML links are restricted to ordinary HTTP(S), mail and telephone references.
  Relative references remain relative for a local file and become absolute when
  the caller supplies a source URL. Script links lose the destination while
  keeping their visible label.
- Format adapters return embedded bytes rather than downloading remote images.
- Text readers retain original Markdown frontmatter for the output layer to
  merge according to its public contract.

## Reference audit and acceptance corpus

The [frozen r9 format audit](validation/formats-recovery-r9.md) of `0022e09`
records 17 strict passes out of 24 fixtures, with four output drifts and three
expected image-only rejections. All 24 records and input hashes are unchanged
from r8. Metadata matches for all 21 successful conversions and assets for
19/21; PDF and PPTX assets still differ. Complete format parity remains open.

The reference implementation was inspected read-only at
`/Users/example-user/work/markitai`. At the audit it contained 209 Python source modules
and 278 test modules. Converter, web extraction, LLM and provider code accounted
for approximately 8.8k, 15k, 9.8k and 5.5k lines respectively. These figures
describe migration scope and are not performance measurements.

The existing project supplies these useful compatibility inputs:

| Reference path (relative to `packages/markitai`) | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/fixtures/` | Office/PDF/email/markup/structured text and legacy format examples |
| `benchmarks/docs_snapshots/expected/` | Four normalized end-to-end Markdown snapshots: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX |
| `tests/defuddle_fixtures/` | 209 paired HTML and expected Markdown cases |
| `tests/fixtures/web/*.expected.json` | Semantic thread and required/forbidden text contracts |
| `benchmarks/local_fixtures/` | Two additional website fixtures |
| `tests/unit/test_structured_text_parity.py` | Encoding, CSV quoting/ragged rows and notebook failure cases |

The recorded reference web benchmark dated 2026-09-22 had a mean score of 96.2
for 209 cases. Its guardrail floor of 86.58 is a tolerated regression boundary,
not the reference quality. The separate two-case corpus scored 99.47. These are
reference records only; this Rust engine has not passed those full gates.

The reference repository's `scripts/benchmarks/` also contains a 49-case cold/warm
performance harness and a 40-case quality audit of Markdown, metadata, image
hashes, dimensions, frontmatter and output assets. Use a frozen source identity
and isolated output directories. Run timing sequentially without concurrent
builds. Record failures and unsupported cases in the denominator. Compare speed
only after a case's content and asset checks pass.

## Dependency choices

The native Office parser dependency is [anydoc](https://github.com/firecrawl/anydoc),
whose Rust API exposes both Markdown and a structured document with embedded
assets. It already backed legacy DOC/PPT in the reference implementation. OOXML
presentations now use their own bounded package reader to retain slide identity
and the reference text-frame contract; other Office formats keep the shared
renderer. Its
native PDF reader cannot do OCR. This project adds its own Office renderer to
avoid discarding embedded images and to control Markitai's output contract. The
PDF adapter calls pdf-inspector's per-page API directly so that one OCR-required
page does not discard readable pages. A separate lopdf pass retrieves embedded
image streams and reports visibility signals without an external rendering engine.

HTML uses [scraper](https://docs.rs/scraper/) for an HTML5 DOM and selectors and
[htmd](https://docs.rs/htmd/) for Markdown serialization after explicit cleaning.
Email uses [mail-parser](https://docs.rs/mail-parser/) to handle MIME and transfer
encodings. Cargo.lock fixes the resolved versions. Changes to dependency versions
must run the corresponding output contracts.

The reference project previously evaluated Calamine and a PDF layout alternative
without adopting them. Their availability alone is insufficient justification
for replacing the committed behavior; compare cell formatting, layout and assets
before selecting a different backend.
