# PDF page OCR and screenshots

The PDF media layer combines typed native page results with a native renderer
and local OCR. It operates in memory; the output layer owns safe file publication.
The Rust core does not start Python, Node, PyMuPDF or a rendering command. The
initial renderer and OCR backends use macOS system frameworks; other platforms
return an explicit error when the required backend is unavailable.

This describes the round-seventeen implementation. Coordinated tests and real
PDF acceptance are pending. The existing [image OCR evidence](validation/native-backends-round16.md)
does not establish this PDF integration's fidelity.

## Page and model routing

Local OCR is selected when OCR is enabled and LLM is disabled, or when
`MARKITAI_NO_VLM_OCR` opts out of VLM OCR. With `ocr.per_page_routing=true`, only
unreliable, empty or visibility-suspect native pages require recognition.
Disabling routing recognizes every page. Other pages retain their original
Markdown, including headings, links and tables. This uses typed reliability
evidence rather than the reference reader's raw character-count threshold.

Extracted pictures of at least 40,000 pixels on retained native pages are also
recognized; their text follows the corresponding image reference. Shared images
are recognized once. Unreadable pictures or a missing backend keep the native
page and reference with a warning; invalid configuration or an unsupported
language on an available backend fails explicitly. Page OCR failure fails the document. Successful blank OCR keeps the
page marker and emits a notice without fabricated body text.

OCR plus LLM normally renders every page, including reliable native pages,
independently of `screenshot.enabled`. The local routing setting does not select
which pages the VLM receives. Explicit screenshots remain a separate request:
with VLM OCR disabled, local OCR plus screenshot enhancement still sends page
images, and the warning explains how to keep those images local.

For PDF files, pure mode without screenshot-only selects text enhancement even
if OCR+LLM produced page images. When page images exist, screenshot-only takes
precedence over pure and selects an image-only prompt. Without LLM, PDF
screenshot-only retains ordinary base Markdown, unlike the URL path. This module
reads `screenshot.enabled` directly; configuration-only `screenshot_only=true`
does not imply capture. The explicit CLI flag applies that implication earlier.

The public in-memory API may use rendered pages for enhancement without returning
persistent screenshot paths. The media object supplies `has_reliable_text` so
fallback decisions use recovered content rather than page markers or comments.
The caller owns the LLM request and public result shaping.

## Pixels, encoding and publication

Pages render at 150 DPI as upright RGB composited over white. Each selected page
is rendered once: screenshot encoding borrows the pixels, then local OCR consumes
the original full-resolution image. Screenshot compression cannot degrade that
OCR input. Reliable native pages without screenshots do not need rendering.

PDF screenshots use `image.format`, `image.quality`, `image.max_width` and
`image.max_height`; browser viewport and tiling settings do not apply. JPEG, PNG
and WebP extensions match actual encoded bytes. WebP is lossless, with a warning
that quality does not affect this encoder. Oversized output falls back to lower
JPEG qualities and then a maximum 1024×1024 image, changing the extension to
`.jpg`. Remaining oversize output is an error rather than a missing page.

Names start as `<output-stem>.page0001.<extension>`, including CLI-reserved
document rename suffixes. Direct core calls without a reserved stem may reuse
identical earlier captures while renaming their Markdown output. The output
layer chooses a safe final name before assembly
adds a reference after that page's content:

```markdown
<!-- Page number: 1 -->

Page body.

<!-- ![Page 1](.markitai/screenshots/report.pdf.page0001.jpg) -->
```

The typed page assembler escapes names as URI path components. Screenshots are
distinct from embedded assets and image counts. `PreparedPdf::finish` returns the
same owned screenshot buffers with the assembled document instead of duplicating
their full payloads.

Successful PDF vision enhancement appends an ordered page-image reference list
even when the model omits it. Pure text enhancement keeps its original body
policy. Before publishing Markdown, the output layer verifies that previously
published screenshots still match their bytes; a concurrent modification fails
instead of silently renaming an already-referenced image.

## Bounds and remaining gaps

- At most 1,000 pages, checked before native text extraction, and 32 million
  pixels per rendered page.
- At most two billion cumulative media pixels. All selected page dimensions are
  checked before rendering; native-picture recognition also consumes this budget.
- At most 5 MiB per screenshot and 100 MiB across retained screenshots. Encoder
  writes stop at the per-image bound to permit a bounded fallback.
- A positive `llm.max_vision_pages_per_document` is checked before rendering when
  the selected LLM branch will send page images. Pure text is not blocked by an
  irrelevant image limit.

These limits fail the document instead of truncating its page sequence. They are
not a measured peak-memory ceiling: readers, system renderers and image encoders
also allocate working storage.

Internal document metadata distinguishes native pages and attempted, nonempty
and blank local OCR pages/pictures. Successful blank recognition counts as OCR
use; failed picture attempts do not. The selected `ocr_path` is recorded;
pixel buffers, page plans and internal image arrays are not exposed as metadata.
These internal diagnostics do not add fields to the existing local-file public
frontmatter contract.

Embedded images remain appended to their source page. Exact placement and
editable vector reconstruction are not implemented. Screenshots preserve visual
composition but do not turn vector drawings into structured Markdown. Recognition
shares the language, reading-order and cancellation limitations in [local OCR](ocr.md).
No handwriting, complex-table or multi-column accuracy guarantee is claimed.
The authored scan currently exposes a concrete accuracy gap: the six-word
transcript ends in `2026`, while the 150-DPI page recognition returns `2ø26`.
Its expected transcript and exact-match test remain unchanged; that test is
explicitly ignored in the ordinary routing gate and exercised by the separate
quality acceptance driver, which reports a partial result. This is an unresolved
recognizer error, not successful transcription. No character substitution is
applied to hide it.
PDFs downloaded through the URL fetch path still use ordinary extraction;
requesting their OCR or screenshots currently returns an explicit unsupported
error. Local PDF media support does not establish parity for that URL path.
